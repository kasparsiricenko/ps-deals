# PS Deals

This is an updated version of my PS4 Deals client app which didn't have backend and required use of getting JSON file and open it.
This version has backend and requests it from PS Store and shows the results.

## Reasoning
It was developed to see the best discount by pervent and by discounted price. Unfortunately PS Store doesn't support sorting by discounted price, only by original price. This app tries to close this gap.

## How to
* To start application use `yarn start` command. 
* Open application on http://localhost:5000
