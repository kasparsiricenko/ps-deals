# PS Deals

This is an app which didn't have backend and it only had support of JSON files which is not convienient.
This version is improved significantly and has backend and requests it directly from PS Store and shows the results.

## Reasoning
It was developed to see the best discount by percentage and by discounted price. Unfortunately PS Store doesn't support sorting by discounted price, only by original price. This app tries to close this gap.

## How to
* To start application use `yarn start` command. 
* Open application on http://localhost:5000
